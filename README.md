# ComfyRage

```
{dog, {leash|}|cat|horse}, [simple_background] // Pre strips comments, expands random, and expands de-emphasis, Show + Debug proves it!
```

# Pre
- strips comments
- expands random {tag1|tag2|etc}, {tag4|}
- expands de-emphasis

# Show
- shows text

# Debug
- passes prompt through ComfyUI to get the weights, pass to Show to see them (gonna make it show on self after refactor)

Thanks!
